1. e4 e6 {Just wanted to try out the french. Briefly looking though it , it
has the feel of a strange Queens Gambit, though a tempo down and under attack.}
2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e5 Nfd7 5. Bd3 c5 6. Nf3 cxd4 7. Nxd4 {This has all
been standard, classical french. I went this way as i felt this was a workable
pawn structure, even if the Bc8 is a little stuck.  On the downside, i felt
like white's having 3 developped pieces and the very advanced pawn was
uncomfortable.} Bb4 $6 {In retrospect i don't like this move. It felt like
pinning the Nc3 was a good plan, but it seems to have just helped massage his
position to his liking and left me with e5 pushing into me.} (7... Nxe5 {
In the game, i felt this was good in terms of material and not having to deal
witht that thorn in my side, but his 3 vs my 1 developed piece was worrying me,
this was a better move though, then just make sure i am developing whilst he
attacks.} 8. Bb5+ Bd7) 8. Bd2 Nxe5 {Should have done it a turn earlier and
then moved my Bb4 to a more useful sq} 9. a3 Bc5 10. Nf3 {I keep missing the
setup of this vicious triangle. It is a very telltale setup of the classic
bishop sac/ greek gift sac. When black castles, Bxh7+ is coming, then Ng5+ and
a very scary possibility of getting mated on h7 or having the king walk all
over the place.  To defend against it, Nxf3 or Nxd3 (the better of the two)
stops any Bishop sac and mating attack. In general having h6 played would also
stop the sac and make Ng5 impossible.} Nbc6 {Nxd3+ preferable, though this isn;
t a disaster.} (10... Nxd3+ 11. cxd3) 11. O-O O-O $4 {Just a bad move. I saw
him do it and presumed myself safe, still ignoring the obvious Nxd3. I am now
clearly going to get sac'd into.} 12. Bxh7+ Kxh7 13. Ng5+ Kg6 {The correct
response, but still a bad situation. Generally in this situation, look at Kg8
if you can control h7, Kh6 and Kg6 if you can't, so that Qg5 doesn't happen.}
14. h4 f6 {I felt this was a good way to free up some space, but only by
chance did it work out for me.} (14... Rh8 {The correct response, as
demonstrated by 15.h5+}) 15. Nxe6 $2 {One turn too early for white, missing
Bxe6, though i missed this in my calculations for a while too. Good reason to
create stepping stone diagrams of all pieces more often!} (15. h5+ $3 {The far
better h5+ trading a N for a Q and still having a vicious attack. I didn't
even consider it, but demonstrates why 14...Rh8 was necessary.} Kh6 16. Nxe6+
Kh7 17. Nxd8) 15... Bxe6 {bmbio won by resignation} 0-1
